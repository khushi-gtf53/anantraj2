        Founded in 1969, Anant Raj Limited carries a lineage that predates the
        formal birth of India’s real estate industry. Its name itself is a
        tribute to the founders’ parents, embedding respect, resilience, and
        responsibility into the very core of the brand. From early stewardship
        of land to decades of construction, Anant Raj has grown into a symbol of
        permanence and credibility, with over 21 million sq. ft. delivered
        across 300+ acres of owned land.
      </p>

      <p className="font-lato text-[14px] font-[400] tracking-[1px] leading-[27px]">
        Even as the world has changed, the essence of Anant Raj has remained
        untouched — a family institution that has passed down values and vision
        across four generations. More than a builder of structures, it has
        become a custodian of legacy, where heritage meets progress and every
        home reflects dignity, continuity, and timeless pride.
